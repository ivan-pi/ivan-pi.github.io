(Last updated on 17/02/2019.)
At university I’m currently working on a project report on pasta drying, analyzing CT datasets of dry pasta, and writing a scientific publication on the same topic. Sounds dry, but it’s not, really. ;)
Outside of work I’m currently:

Creating my personal website.
Adding finishing touches to the Modern Fortran NLopt wrapper. I posted about it recently on the Intel Fortran Forum.
Tinkering with PDEONE.
