🏢 Room 1.OG 37, iGZW (TUM RoomFinder), Google Maps Research interests: Lattice Boltzmann methods and their application to fluid dynamics, multiphase flow, mass transport, heat transfer and chemical reactions. Off-lattice Boltzmann methods Meshless methods in fluid and solid mechanics. Computational methods for the solution of partial differential equations. Mathematical modelling in life sciences. Background I received my master’s degree in chemical engineering at the Faculty of Chemisty and Chemical Technology, University of Ljubljana in the microprocess engineering group. My thesis titled “The Description of Chemical Reactions with the Lattice Boltzmann Method” was supervised by Prof. Dr. Igor Plazl and Prof. Dr. Tomaz Urbic. In the final year of my master’s I also worked shortly as a student researcher at the Parallel and Distributed Systems Laboratory at the Jozef Stefan Institute as a developer of the medusa meshless method library.">
