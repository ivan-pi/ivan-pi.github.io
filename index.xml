      <description>As many before me, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I need a website to share some of my work and ideas in an uncensored fashion. I set up this page almost a year ago, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t add any content in the meanwhile. This was in part simply due to lack of motivation and second due to focusing on other projects (I&amp;rsquo;m saving some of these for blog posts).
Getting back to the website was easier this time round.</description>

      <description>Hugo is the world’s fastest framework for building websites. It is written in Go.
It makes use of a variety of open source projects including:

      <description>In my free time I like to work on scientific coding projects in Fortran.
Fortran interfaces  nlopt METIS FLANN: Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (original library here)  Legacy code  Algorithm 494: PDEONE is a subroutine developed by Sincovec and Madsen in 1975 for solving one-dimensional systems of PDEs using the method of lines. Second-order centered difference approximations are used to discretize the spatial variable and yield a system of ordinary differential equations that can be integrated in time with a robust ODE integrator (like LSODE).</description>

      <description>This is my /now page, inspired by Derek Sivers and others at nownownow.com.
 (Last updated on 17/02/2019.)
At university I’m currently working on a project report on pasta drying, analyzing CT datasets of dry pasta, and writing a scientific publication on the same topic. Sounds dry, but it’s not, really. ;)
Outside of work I’m currently:
 Creating my personal website. Adding finishing touches to the Modern Fortran NLopt wrapper.</description>
