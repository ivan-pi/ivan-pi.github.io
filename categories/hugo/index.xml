      <description>&lt;p&gt;As many before me, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I need a website to share some of my work and ideas in an uncensored fashion. I set up this page almost a year ago, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t add any content in the meanwhile. This was in part simply due to lack of motivation and second due to focusing on other projects (I&amp;rsquo;m saving some of these for blog posts).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting back to the website was easier this time round. Still I have decided to document the process of creating the website, so I can come back to it easily at any future point (hopefully sooner than one year).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
